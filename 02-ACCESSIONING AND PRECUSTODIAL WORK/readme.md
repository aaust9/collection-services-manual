Precustodial work is all work that occurs before a collection is formally transferred 
to the Rose Library. It includes the packing, shipping, and receiving of material, as 
well as managing the paperwork required to formally transfer a collection or item. 
Collection Services staff should be prepared to work with donors, vendors, and 
curators to provide guidance on any precustodial actions taken by the Library. 

## 2.1 Consultations with donors

Prior to a collection being acquired by the Rose Library, The Head of Collection 
Services may consult with curators to draft an [Operational Impact Statement](https://emory.box.com/s/btfvoh8gltpob8ynj8uhe3r7348pr455) to assess the overall space and supply needs of a collection, as well as cost of transfer, accessioning, processing, and storing a collection.  

Additionally, collection services staff may meet with donors or curators to provide 
guidance and assistance on matters such as: 

*	Packing and shipping
*	Transfer of of born-digital material (see forms and procedures [here](https://emory.box.com/s/ykvtm447e8e3b92gb7kvmqe84o3xugtf)) 
*	Appraisal
*	Arrangement and description
*	Conservation

## 2.2 Collections receiving 

Collections receiving is the physical transfer of collection material from a donor, individual seller, or vendor to the Stuart A. Rose Manuscript, Archives, & Rare Book Library. The primary point of contact for collections receiving for Emory University Archives at the Rose Library is the University Archivist. The primary point of contact for collections receiving for all other units at the Rose Library is the Acquisitions Assistant.

### 2.2.1 Receipt of New or Potential Acquisitions 

All collection material should be received and opened/unpacked by the Acquisitions Assistant. 

Small packages will be delivered to the Rose Library mailroom. Larger packages or collections will be delivered to the main Woodruff mailroom. The main Woodruff mailroom on Level 2 is not a secure space and collection material should be moved to a secure holdings location as soon as possible upon arrival. 

**New Acquisition Storage:**

Acquisitions that measure 10 linear feet or fewer will be unpacked and stored on the new acquisition storage shelves on Level 9, given space. Larger acquisitions will be moved to additional holding spaces on Level 9 or 11. Hard drives storing born-digital collection material should be securely stored in the Digital Archives lab while awaiting accessioning. In some circumstances, material may be received at the Library Service Center (LSC). All new acquisitions should be labelled with the creator, potential collection title, date of receipt, and temporary box number upon receipt. These labels can be in the form of printed or handwritten labels, depending on which is most efficient. If the collection arrives with temporary box numbers, no need to re-number, re-write, or add to a printed label. The Accessioning and Collections Manager will log all new acquisitions greater than 1 linear foot in the pending acquisitions tab on the Master Shelf List. 

Upon receipt of material the Acquisitions Assistant will:  

*	Open and unpack collection material less than 1 linear foot.
*	Add all material to either the [Gift or Purchase Acquisitions Log](https://emory.app.box.com/folder/2493112313) as appropriate.
*	Place the items and any accompanying documentation onto the appropriate shelf for curatorial review for material less than 1 linear foot. 
*   Consult with the Accessioning and Collections Manager to locate stacks space forcollection material greater than 1 linear foot.
*	Alert the Curator that material is ready to be reviewed (Curator will make final 
	decision on whether to move forward with the acquisition).
	
If the curator decides to not move forward with an acquisition, it is the curator's 
responsibility to notify the donor/seller. The Acquisitions Assistant 
can help coordinate return of the material, once the donor/seller has been notified 
by the curator. 

### 2.2.2 Paperwork

No collection material may be cataloged or accessioned until the appropriate 
paperwork has been received. All paperwork should be transferred to the Acquisitions Assistant.  

**Managing Paperwork in Box**

Rose staff stores and manages all acquisitions-related paperwork on Box.  Box allows 
staff to access shared folders and communicate with one another inside the 
application, creating and maintaining a record of communications for each 
acquisition.  

There are two Box folders that we use to manage this process-the [Rose Library 
Purchase Payments folder](https://emory.app.box.com/folder/1583996619) and the [Rose Library Gift in Kind process folder](https://emory.app.box.com/folder/1957394682).  Each of these folders is subdivided by step in the acquisition process and then by major collecting area. As new collections move through the acquisitions process, the Acquisitions Assistant will update the files and move the paperwork into a folder associated with the next stage of the process.  As paperwork moves through the process, the Acquisitions Assistant will use the tagging and task list functionsin Box to update Rose Library and LITS staff members about the status of the acquisition or to alert someone when an action is required. 

**Paperwork Required for Purchase Payment**

The Rose Library requires the following [forms](https://emory.app.box.com/folder/2123324954) for purchases: 

*	Invoice (Acquisitions Assistant will generate an invoice to accompany a Deed of Sale)
*	Payment Request Form (PRF)
*	Deed of Sale (for purchases from private individuals)
*	Domestic Vendors: Supplier/Individual Information Form (SIIF) and an ACH Payment 
	Authorization Form (ACH)
*	International Vendors: W-8BEN-E (businesses)/W-8BEN (individuals) and Foreign 
	Wire Transfer Form (Note: These must be submitted with the vendor every time they are paid, regardless of how long it has been since they were last paid.)
*	Vendor Forms are required when any of the following are true: 

	*	The seller is new
	*	The Rose Library has not purchased from the seller within the last 14 months
	*	The seller's information (including address) has changed since we last 
		purchased material from them
		
**Managing Purchase Paperwork in Box**

The Rose Library manages purchase paperwork on Box through the [Rose Library Purchases 
Payments folder](https://emory.app.box.com/folder/1583996619).  This folder is organized into subfolders by process step and then 
by collecting area.   

*	**Step 1:** Received and Pending
	
	*	Curators or Acquisitions Assistant upload preliminary paperwork for prospective acquisitions such as invoices, One-Pagers, or Appraisal reports to this folder.      
	*	Acquisitions Assistant either confirms that a seller is an active vendor with the University or contacts new vendors and sellers to obtain vendor paperwork. 
	*	Acquisitions Assistant confirms that all required paperwork has been submitted and combines the vital documents into one file. Vital documents include the invoice, the Deed of Sale, vendor documents, if applicable, and the PRF.  
	*	File titles should be structured to include the vendor name, invoice number 
		and fiscal year. For example: "Vendor or Seller Name_Invoice Number_Fiscal 
		Year," such as "John Doe Bookseller_123456_FY17." 
	*	Once all paperwork is submitted, the file moves to step 2.
	
*	**Step 2:** Submitted PRFs
	
	*	Acquisitions Assistant tags the Associate Director and Director to approve the disbursement of funds.   
	*	Director or Associate Director will approve in the Box comment section.
	*	Once the purchase has been approved, the file moves to step 3.
	
*	**Step 3:** Verified

	*	Acquisitions Assistant tags the Senior Accounting Assistant in LITS Finance “Submitted in Alma, POL #” 
	*	At some future point, the Senior Accounting Assistant in LITS Finance will comment with final payment information but, for now, the acquisition is considered “paid” and can move forward in the process. 
	*	The Acquisitions Assistant tags the Accessioning and Collections Manager, “Acquisition complete” 
	*	The Accessioning and Collections Manager tags the accessioning team on purchases including manuscript material to alert them that the material can now be accessioned. The Accessioning and Collections Manager will also physically move material to shelving in the accessioning and cataloging areas, as needed. 
			
At the end of each fiscal year, the Acquisitions Assistant moves all 
completed paperwork in the Step 3 folder for purchases into a new subfolder titled 
"FY--" (e.g., FY16).

**Paperwork Required for Gifts in Kind**

The following [paperwork](https://emory.app.box.com/folder/2791519373) is required to process and accession gifts: 

*	Signed Gift in Kind Contribution Form (required for all gifts)
*	Deed of Gift (required for manuscript collections that a donor or appraiser 
	values over $5000 and for which the donor wants to claim a taxwrite-off, or collections with any terms, conditions, or restrictions 
	imposed by the donor)
	
**NOTE:** For gifts containing only books, the Rose Library only requires a Gift-in-Kind Contribution Form in order to proceed with cataloging, but Emory's department of Development and Alumni Relations (DAR) may require additional paperwork and an appraisal, depending on the value that the donor places on the gift. In this case it is DAR's responsibility to pursue documentation beyond the Gift in Kind Contribution Form.

**Managing Gift Paperwork in Box**

The Rose Library manages gift paperwork on Box through the [Rose Library Gift in Kind 
Process folder](https://emory.app.box.com/folder/1957394682). This folder is organized into subfolders by process step and then by 
collecting area.  The Acquisitions Assistant is responsible for 
combining paperwork into a single PDF file, moving that file between the Box folders, 
and tagging appropriate parties for next steps.

*	**Step 1:** Gifts Received by Acquisitions Assistant 

	*	Curators or Acquisitions Assistant upload preliminary paperwork for prospective acquisitions. This could include one pagers, appraisal reports, or Box Notes detailing conversations and negotiations with donors.  
	*	Curators are responsible for procuring the appropriate paperwork from donors.
	*	All files should follow the naming convention:  "Donor Name_Calendar Year 
		Received," such as "John Doe_2016."
	*	Once an acquisition has a completed Gift in Kind Contribution Form, and, if necessary, a Deed of Gift, the Acquisitions Assistant moves the paperwork to the folder.
		
*	**Step 2:** Gifts Ready for Acknowledgement by Rose Director

	*	The Acquisitions Assistant notifies the Accessioning and Collections Manager with a Box tag.
	*   If the gift contains manuscript material, the Accessioning and Collections Manager notifies the accessioning team via a Box tag to alert them that the material can now be accessioned.  
	*	At this point, the Accessioning and Collections Manager also moves material to the accessioning and cataloging areas, as needed. 
	*	The Acquisitions Assistant notifies the Administrative Assistant with a Box tag.  
	*	The Administrative Assistant drafts an acknowledgement letter and facilitates getting it signed by the Director. 
	*   The Administrative Assistant sends the acknowledgement letter and leaves a note in Box with this information.  
	*   At that point, the Acquisitions Assistant moves the documentation to Gifts Ready for DAR Acknowledgment. 
		
*	**Step 3:** Gifts Ready for DAR Acknowledgment

	*	The Acquisitions Assistant tags the Director and Assistant Director of Development for the Libraries on Box. 
	*	DAR will acknowledge the gift and file a copy of the Gift in Kind in their 
		records.
		
At the end of the calendar year, the Acquisitions Assistant moves all 
completed paperwork in the Step 3 folder for gifts into a new subfolder for the 
calendar year.

Unsolicited gifts are documented in the Step 1: Gifts Received by Acquisitions Assistant, usually with a Boxnote, but may be represented with a letter, or other documentation from the donor. When creating a Boxnote for an unsolicited gift, include contact information for the donor, the contents of the gift, the physical size of the gift, and the date of arrival. The curator must confirm that they would like to accept these gifts prior to moving forward. The Acquisitions Assistant is responsible for following up with the donor to obtain proper paperwork and may contact the Administrative Assistant to mail a donor packet to them if the only available contact information is a mailing address.  
 

### 2.2.3 Financial Appraisal

Collections may be appraised in two circumstances:

1. If a donor would like to take a tax write-off greater than $5000 on a gift or;
2. If curators need a professional evaluation to determine a fair purchase price for a prospective acquisition.   

It is the donor's responsibility to arrange appraisals for tax purposes.

Collection Services staff may occasionally be called on to assist in coordinating and 
facilitating financial appraisals of Rose Library collections or potential 
acquisitions.  While we can facilitate the work of professional appraisers, Rose 
Library staff cannot provide or estimate a value for any special collections material 
per the [ACRL Code of Ethics for Special Collections Librarians](http://rbms.info/standards/code_of_ethics/), nor can we provide any tax advice to 
donors.  

If a curator or administrator chooses to engage an appraiser, they must schedule the 
appointment with the appraiser and contact the Accessioning and Collections Manager 
or Head of Collection Services as early as possible.

Once an appraisal is scheduled, the Accessioning and Collections Manager will: 

*	Reserve the Folio Room for the appointment  
*	Notify Research Services staff
*	Move the material to the Collections Transition Room (CTR) in advance of the visit
*	Return material to its holding location when the appraisal is concluded

Invoices for an appraiser’s services should be directed to the Administrative Assistant. Appraisal reports prepared for collection material we are acquiring should be provided to the Acquisitions Assistant, who will post them to Box for everyone’s access.  

**NOTE:** this is the only instance when unaccessioned and uncataloged material 
should be stored in the CTR and/or made available in the Reading Room. Collection 
Services is not responsible for assisting the appraiser with any billing or travel 
issues; those inquiries should be directed to the Rose Administrative Assistant.

## 2.3 Accessioning

Accessioning is the formal act of taking legal and physical control of an archival or 
manuscript collection. Formally accessioning material helps to establish the 
authenticity of the material through documenting chain of custody. It also gives the 
Rose Library administrative and custodial control over collections and shows that the 
library is acting in good faith when accepting archival material by documenting the 
transfer and its terms. 

The Rose Library aims to make all new acquisitions available to researchers 
immediately following accessioning. Therefore, accessioning new material requires 
sufficient description to make the collection discoverable and usable. Material must 
be described at minimum at the box level, but other descriptive information may be 
limited. Detailed processing is not common at this time, though may be warranted 
(e.g. the collection is quite small, researcher need is high). 

Determine the appropriate [level of processing](/04-LEVELS%20OF%20ARRANGEMENT%20AND%20DESCRIPTION) at the time of accessioning and then move forward with creating the descriptive documents.

### 2.3.1 Managing Accessioning Workflow

When material has been either acknowledged or paid for and is ready to be accessioned 
the Accessioning and Collections Manager will share this information with the 
accessioning team. 

*	When new acquisitions are ready to be accessioned, the Accessioning and 
	Collections Manager tags the accessioning team in Box.
*	The Accessioning and Collections Manager maintains a whiteboard with all new 
	manuscript acquisitions and marks the ones that are ready for discussion at the 
	weekly accessioning meeting.
*	During this meeting, the Accessioning and Collections Manager and the Acquisitions Assistant updates the team on 
	the status of pending collections and gives information on any significant, new 
	collections that have entered the acquisitions process.
*	The accessioning team members add collections to their individual accessioning 
	queues based on current workloads and specific expertise.
*	The Accessioning and Collections Manager distributes original paperwork for the 
	new assignments.

### 2.3.2 Creation of the Accession Record

The system of record for accession information is the Accessions Database located on the F: Drive:  ``F:/MARBL/Accession Database/Manuscript Accessions.mbd``.  All new collection material receives a record in this database upon receipt. One accession record should be created per acquisition, meaning there should be at least one record for each invoice, deed, and/or Gift-in-Kind Contribution form. For collections acquired through a simultaneous purchase and gift, there should be separate accession records for each contract.

**Navigating the Database and Using Microsoft Access**

To create the accession record, from the main menu of the accession database select 
"Edit Existing Records." At the next menu choose "Edit Accession Records." This will 
open the database to the first record. At the bottom of the page, click the double 
arrow, which will progress the database to the last record. Make note of the 
accession number on the last record.

To add a new record, click "Add Record" at the bottom of the page, and a blank form 
will open. 

**Populating the Accesssion Record**

Below is a sample record in the accessions database.  The record should be as fully 
fleshed out as you are able to make it with the information available to you.  Not 
all fields are required for each new accession, but it is the intent to capture as 
much information about the collection and its transfer as you can at this stage.

Once the manuscript number is assigned and entered into the database, add the new manuscript number, title statement, and acquisition date to the Manuscript Register on Box. |
| Date received                                | This field auto-populates with the current date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

You can either type a name into this box, or there are some pre-populated names you can select from the menu.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Disposition                                  | Choose either “Addition” or “Establish Collection” from the drop down menu.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Receipt type                                 | Choose either “Gift,” “Purchase,” “University Archives Transfer,” “Deposit,” or “Other” from the drop down list.,In the majority of cases the acquisition is either a gift or a purchase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Related note                                 | The Related note field next to Receipt type field is used to note special information about the material, for example that the acquisition is covered by a previous deed of gift or that the value of items purchased in foreign currency has been converted to dollars. For example: "Original price of £17,425 converted to US dollars" or "No new paperwork. Covered under original deed of gift/sale."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Restrictions                                 | Note any restrictions stipulated by the deed of gift or sale in this field. There is a character limit on this field, so if there is restriction information that cannot be contained in this field use this field to refer readers to the “Brief Description of Material” field and record restriction information there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Source of acquisition                        | Record the immediate source of acquisition here.,This is generally the name of a donor or a rare book and manuscript dealer and can be found on invoices, deeds, and other acquisition paperwork.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Address/Email Address/Phone Number of Source | Populate these fields with the contact information for the Source of Acquisition.,The address field is required, and the record will not save if this field is blank.,If you do not have an address for the source of the collection you should enter “address unknown.”,Email and phone number should be filled out if the information is known.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Provenance                                   | In the Provenance field, explain the relationship of the donor to the creator of the records. For example, “Donor is creator of records,” or “Donor is executor of creator’s estate.”,For collections that are purchased from a dealer with no other known provenance or custodial history information record that the collection was “Purchased from dealer; provenance unknown.”,If you have additional information about how the records changed hands over time it should be recorded here.,For additional guidance on recording provenance (see [5.1.15 Custodial history](/05-DESCRIPTION#5115-custodial-history) for more information).                                                                     |
| Extent                                       | Record the extent of the material, using linear footage when possible. Many new accessions will be single items added to existing collections, in which case number of items can be used for extent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Brief description of materials               | The Brief Description of Materials field should include a description of the creator and a clear description of the materials. Specific language is used in this field to indicate whether the acquisition is a new collection or an addition to an existing collection. See [figure 2](#figure2) and [figure 3](#figure3) for examples. In some cases an addition to a collection will come from a different source or have a different provenance than the original materials.  In these cases it is particularly important that we be able to track which items came from which sources.  In miscellany collections or instances where the addition is very small (a few files), write the accession number on the folder and integrate the folders into the collection and note the Box and Folder number in the Brief Description of Materials field. For large additions, note the box numbers in the field and add the new custodial history information to the note in the finding aid (see [5.1.15 Custodial history](/05-DESCRIPTION#5115-custodial-history) for more information).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Appraised Value/Appraisal Date               | If a collection has been financially appraised or the donor has filled out the “Value” line on the Gift in Kind form record that information in this field along with the date of the appraisal or GIK. If a collection has been appraised and is then purchased by the Rose Library do not include the appraised value in this field, you will record the actual purchase price in the Purchase Price field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Purchase price                               | Record the purchase price of the item(s) or collection.,If the invoice reflects an international currency, convert to dollars and include the original purchase price in the Related Notes field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Accessioned by                               | Add your initials.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Finalizing the record                        | When you have finished filling out the record, press the Save Record button. Use the Print Record button to print at least two copies of the record, one for the collection file and one for the accession files. If you assigned a new manuscript number, press the Description Data button, then click Fill Data, then Save. This creates an entry in the database’s Manuscript Register.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## 2.3.3 Accessioning Digital Objects

In order to ensure consistency across accession records, archivists should use the digital archives controlled vocabulary to describe digital objects (see [2.3.4.1 Digital archives controlled vocabulary](#2341-digital-archives-controlled-vocabulary)).

Typically, if we receive laptops or personal computers, we will only retain the internal hard drive following processing. The Digital Archivist will send all other hardware and casings to surplus. You should therefore describe laptops and computers as “hard drives” in accession records (see [2.3.4.1 Digital archives controlled vocabulary](#2341-digital-archives-controlled-vocabulary)). If we do have reason to keep the entire computer (either because they feature labels and markings intentionally added by the donor/creator that contribute significant meaning or because the entire computer will be required in order to access and transfer files), describe these as either “laptop computers” or “microcomputers.” Consult with the digital archivist if you are unsure of which term to use.
						
Apart from exceptional cases, you should not accession computer peripherals (monitors, keyboards, etc.), networking hardware (routers, for example), and other electronic components not used to store data unless:

* They feature labels and markings intentionally added by the donor/creator that contribute significant meaning to the collection. These should not be labels or markings that simply denote ownership or give instruction on use or function (i.e., “Dorothy’s mouse” or “plug in here”).
* In cases where the associated hardware is particularly old or obscure and it has been deemed likely, following consultation with a digital archivist, that this equipment will be required in order to access and transfer digital files from the associated hardware.

If you have questions about whether a digital object should be accessioned, consult with the digital archivist.

## 2.3.4 Accessioning Workflows

Like all collection material, born-digital media and files should not be accessioned until paperwork has been completed. The workflow will vary slightly depending on the method of transfer or if the born-digital material is part of a hybrid collection.  

If a hybrid collection includes known born-digital media and/or hardware:

* During the weekly accessioning meeting, the Accessioning and Collections Manager assigns hybrid collection to a member of the accessioning team. 
* The accessioning archivist adds information regarding any known born-digital media and/or hardware to the born-digital inventory, which is stored as a tab in the master shelf list.
* The accessioning archivist accessions the born-digital media and/or hardware with the rest of the collection, using the digital archives controlled vocabulary (listed below) to describe what is included.
* Archivists should keep smaller pieces of born-digital media such as floppy disks or flash drives with the collection when moved to the stacks. The Digital Archivist and Accessioning and Collections Manager will identify a storage location for computer towers and laptops.  The accessioning team member will shelve the computer and record the location in the born-digital inventory and the master shelf list.
* If it is a small amount of born-digital material, the accessioning archivist should create the disk images for the collection.  This decision should be made in consultation with the digital archivist.

If a collection (or addition to a collection) is comprised exclusively of born-digital media and/or hardware:

* The Accessioning and Collections Manager notifies and assigns accessioning responsibilities to the Digital Archivist. born-digital media and/or hardware is temporarily stored in the accessioning area until retrieved by the digital archivist for accessioning.
* The digital archivist accessions the born-digital media and/or hardware, using the digital archives controlled vocabulary (see [2.3.4.1 Digital archives controlled vocabulary](#2341-digital-archives-controlled-vocabulary)) to describe what is included.
* Where possible, the digital archivist will image disks and ingest disk images into the digital repository at the point of accessioning.
* The digital archivist adds information about the file transfer to the born-digital inventory, which is stored as a tab in the master shelf list. The archivist should also note whether they have ingested the material into the digital repository.
* The digital archivist creates BD box(es) for accessioned media, including hard drives removed from laptops and computer towers.  If it is not possible to remove a hard drive from its casing, the location of the hardware will be recorded on the master shelf list and the born-digital inventory.

**Note:** If imaging is completed at the time of accessioning, born-digital media and hardware can be transferred immediately to the LSC. 

If a hybrid collection includes a file transfer:

* The receiving digital archivist notifies the Accessioning and Collections Manager that a file transfer has been received.
* The receiving digital archivist moves the transferred files to a temporary storage location on the digital archive lab’s local hard drives. Due to preservation concerns, the digital archivist may ingest transferred files into the digital repository prior to the completion of accessioning.
* During the weekly accessioning meeting, the Accessioning and Collections Manager assigns hybrid collection to a member of the accessioning team. 
* The accessioning archivist adds information about the file transfer to the born-digital inventory, and notes whether they have ingested the files into the digital repository.
* The accessioning archivist accessions the file transfer with the rest of the collection, using the term “Digital files” taken from the digital archives controlled vocabulary (see [2.3.4.1 Digital archives controlled vocabulary](#2341-digital-archives-controlled-vocabulary)) to describe what is included.
