We collect data and conduct assessments to help us more effectively prioritize, plan, schedule, execute, and communicate the value of our work.   

## 11.1 Output Metrics and Statistics

We collect metrics on processing and cataloging outputs in order to help us better manage our work and to make realistic projections about the resources and time required for various projects.  The intent of a processing and cataloging metrics program is not to measure the productivity of individual staff or to evaluate performance. The intent is to measure processes, i.e., assessing the time and resources required to process collections or catalog print items, and the impacts of taking particular approaches. Data points can be used to estimate and project the staff and resources needed to conduct various projects and to help develop benchmarks. This information can also be used to justify staffing and the financial resources needed in the context of discussions with donors or when preparing grant applications. These numbers help us communicate the value of Collection Services' labor to administrators, colleagues, and donors.  

We report quarterly on our output statistics via the Collection Services quarterly reports and an annual report at the end of each fiscal year. Each person is responsible for managing their own stats and getting them to Head of Collection Services quarterly.

We keep statistics in the following areas:  

### 11.1.1 Accessioning

* Number of accessioned collections;
* Linear footage and OP/BV count of accessioned collections;
* Number of items for additions to miscellany or artificial collections.

We track these through ArchivesSpace and can generate reports as needed.

### 11.1.2 Processing

* Number of collections completed and in progress;
* Linear footage and OP/BV count processed each quarter;
* Level to which collection is arranged and described;
* Number of GB processed.

We track these statistics on a [spreadsheet](<https://emory.app.box.com/file/243119095713> "https://emory.app.box.com/file/243119095713").  Each person is responsible for managing their own stats and getting them to Head of Collection Services quarterly.  

### 11.1.3 Born-Digital Collections

* Born-digital acquisitions (amount transferred via imaging or file transfer in GB);
* Amount ingested into the Keep (in GB);
* Amount processed and made available in RR (in GB). 

We track these statistics in the [Master Shelf List](https://emory.box.com/s/zxb8uqgc2kl8vqwn6p6316k9bezq9nvm) and a tab in the [annual processing report](<https://emory.app.box.com/file/243119095713> "https://emory.app.box.com/file/243119095713")

### 11.1.4 Cataloging (print)

* Number of new monograph titles;
* Number of monograph issues or volumes;
* Number of serial titles;
* Number of serial issues;
* Parent collection/collecting area (General monographs and serials, Danowski monographs and serials, Emory University Archives, and selected other project-based categories as needed).

We track these statistics on a [spreadsheet](<https://emory.app.box.com/folder/42712015208> "https://emory.app.box.com/folder/42712015208")

Danowski and Billops-Hatch print cataloging statistics are also reported annually to their respective boards. 

### 11.1.5 Receiving

* Number of new acquisitions received;
* Number of purchases paid for;
* Number of purchases acquired and paid for within the same quarter and fiscal year;
* Number of gifts received and documented within the same quarter and fiscal year;
* Extents of material received.

The Accessioning Archivist tracks purchases and gifts in the [Acquisitions Receiving Logs](https://emory.box.com/s/zjnllx6bntj7hnzlh1m8heebibm030ol). The Accessioning Archivist [compiles the collections receiving statistics](https://emory.box.com/s/u78dhmnv3ewxkesvt4wk8kri363dx2m9) based on that tracking. 

### 11.1.6 Emory Finding Aids and Alma

We also collect the following statistics by generating reports from EmoryFindingAids and Alma:

Cataloging (manuscripts):

* Number of MARC records created;
* Number of MARC records edited or updated.

EAD Finding aids:

* Number of new EAD finding aids;
* Number of EAD finding aids edited or updated.

## 11.2 Qualitative Assessments and Impact Statements

In addition to quantitative data and metrics, Collection Services also collects stories, anecdotes, and qualitative data around the work that we do and the positive impact that it has on our colleagues and our users.  This helps the unit to draft a broader narrative about our individual and shared work that includes not just what we hold and what we do, but that also communicates why it matters.
