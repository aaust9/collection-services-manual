## 12.1 Training

Approaches to training for students and new professional staff will vary.  Students need introductions to both basic archival principles and local practices, while new professional staff may only need orientation to local practice.  Training for new staff may also include training in advanced concepts relating to cataloging and systems.  All training is iterative and will occur as new skills become necessary. 

### 12.1.1 Students

Create an orientation packet for a new student's first day. Include:

* Rose and Woodruff Libraries orientation materials:
	 * Rose Library promotional material
	 * Rose Library welcome and rules
	 * LITS Student Employee Handbook
	 * Emergency procedures
	 * Student attendance policy
	 * Collection Services policy and procedure manual
* Professional readings [for manuscript and archival processing assistants only]:
	 * Roe, Kathleen D., Arranging and Describing Archives and Manuscripts, Society of American Archivists, 2005.  Chapters 1, 2 and 4. 
	 * O'Toole, James M. and Richard Cox, Understanding Archives and Manuscripts, Society of American Archivists, 2006.  Chapters 3 and 4 (including chapter 2 for an optional historical perspective). 
	 * [Society of American Archivists Core Values and Code of Ethics](http://www2.archivists.org/statements/saa-core-values-statement-and-code-of-ethics).  
	 
On the first day, the supervisor should review the library orientation material with the student(s).  It is especially important during this review to talk in detail about the Rose Library welcome and rules document and to set any additional expectations for student behavior.  Emphasize that many of these rules, such as not allowing bags or food on the 9th floor, are for security and preservation of the materials.  If there are additional rules and expectations for working on your team, make these clear during this meeting.  For example, whether or not students may carry their phones with them or what kinds of media they can consume while working.  Also be sure to review the LITS student handbook to ensure the student(s) know how to clock in and out and that they are aware of wider library rules that may differ from those of the Rose Library.  Give the student a tour of the Rose Library, including the 11th floor, and test the student(s)' prox card for access to secure work spaces. 

When training graduate processing assistants, following the tour and review of orientation material, give the student(s) time to read the Collection Services policy and procedures manual and the professional readings you've included in the packet.  This may take a significant portion of their first two shifts.  Encourage them to read the materials closely and reassure them that it's okay to take their time.  When they've finished reading, discuss any questions they have and take some time to talk in depth about archival principles and the goals of arrangement and description.   

It's helpful at this point to remind them that they aren't expected to memorize everything on the first day and that you'll work closely with them to teach new skills as they become necessary.  Remind the student(s) also to keep their copy of the policy and procedures manual and refer to it when they have questions.  If possible, plan to work alongside students regularly for their first few months.  Completing tasks together improves the learning process for new students.  Additionally, being in close proximity to answer questions as they arise and to model good practice minimizes student mistakes. 

### 12.1.2 New Staff

In advance of a new staff person starting work, review the Rose Library [onboarding checklist](https://emory.box.com/s/vezrlfps7nsdy6jhd641lndpb3ok8oy2) and new staff handbook [link]. 

New professional staff will have the benefit of graduate training in library and/or archival theory, and may also have prior professional experience.  It won't be necessary to spend a lot of time reviewing basic practice with them.  However, it is important to gauge their experience and knowledge and plan training accordingly.  Most training will be focused on local practice and ensuring the new staff person's performance meets expectations for consistency, clarity, attention to detail, and problem solving.  Set expectations early and continue to reinforce training as the person gains proficiency.  Remember that the nature of special collections work means that training will occur over a period of months, not weeks. 

General tips: 

* Create training schedule for first week or two to create structure and ease transition;
* Have new staff person shadow other staff when learning new tasks;
* Rely on staff who are experts in various topics to lead training in those areas.

## 12.2 Self-Care During Processing

Self-care at work is important.  Our work requires a lot of physical activity such as lifting and carrying heavy boxes that, if done improperly, can lead to injury.  Additionally, we are often asked to work with historical materials documenting difficult or triggering events and topics.  Protecting ourselves physically and mentally is a crucial element of maintaining productivity and remaining good stewards of our collections.  It is important to pay attention to your body; only you will know when something doesn't feel right and you need a break.  Always talk to your supervisor if there is a problem or if you have concerns about something in the workplace.  We can address problems or provide you with resources that can help.   

### 12.2.1 Physical Care

The average records center carton containing books or archival material weighs approximately 40-50 pounds.  It's common for boxes to weigh much more, depending on the contents, or to be especially large or awkwardly shaped.  Lifting boxes improperly or removing them from shelves/carts improperly can lead to back or neck injuries and pulled muscles.   

Guidelines for Lifting: 

* Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart
* Bend your knees and squat down to the box
* Grasp the box firmly and hold it close to your body
* Keeping your back straight and your shoulders back, slowly stand up, pushing with your legs
* Change direction with your feet and hips to move forward
* Follow these steps to return the box
* DO NOT bend forward at the waist and lift 
* DO NOT lift a box above your shoulders 
* Avoid twisting and turning at the waist while lifting 
* If the box is too heavy to manage on your own, ask for help from a colleague or your supervisor 

See http://www.webmd.com/back-pain/proper-lifting-technique for additional guidance.

Guidelines for Removing Boxes from the Shelf:

* To remove boxes from high shelves, use a step stool or library ladder 
* Make sure the stool or ladder is stable before climbing 
* You should be chest-level with the box before attempting to remove it 
* Grasp the box handle firmly and slide it toward you, supporting the bottom of the box 
* Hold the box close to your body and carefully descend the stool or ladder 
* If the box is difficult to reach, as for help from a colleague 
* DO NOT remove boxes from shelves above your head by reaching 
* To remove boxes from low shelves, follow the instructions for proper lifting 

Guidelines for Moving Boxes:

* Use a cart to move records center cartons, large boxes/items, or heavy boxes 
* DO NOT carry more than one box at a time
* DO NOT carry boxes for long periods of time 
* DO NOT carry boxes up or down stairs 

Much of the work of processing requires sitting for long periods of time and can lead to muscle fatigue and other ergonomic injuries.  Maintaining good posture while working and taking breaks to stretch can alleviate these problems.  While sitting, be sure your chair is positioned so that you're working with your elbows at a 90-degree angle, your thighs parallel to the floor, and your feet flat on the floor.  The top of your computer monitor should be at or slightly below eye level.  The chairs have adjustable lumbar supports for your lower back. 

See http://ergonomics.ucr.edu/signs_symptoms.html for more information.

For every four hours worked, take a 15-minute break to stand up, walk around, and stretch.  Do this at the two-hour mark.  If this is not adequate, spend a few minutes stretching each hour.  There are examples below of stretches you can do to avoid injuries caused by poor posture, sitting for long periods, and repetitive activities.  If there are tasks you can do while standing, such as sorting materials, you should feel free to do so.

Archival collections frequently arrive at the archives dirty from age and/or poor storage environments.  Dirt and dust can aggravate allergies causing runny nose, cough, and itchy eyes.  As archivists we must also occasionally work with hazardous materials such as mold.  Mold inhalation can cause serious illness so it is especially important to protect yourself.  Your supervisor can provide you with protective gear. 

* Wash your hands frequently 
* Wear gloves 
* Wear an apron (be sure to wash your clothes when you get home) 
* Wear an N-95 respirator 
* Clean your workspace with Clorox wipes when finished 
* Further training can be provided by Conservation staff if necessary 

There are other tips and general guidelines for physical self-care while working in archives:

* Take plenty of water breaks to stay hydrated.  Archives tend to be dry and dehydration can exacerbate issues such as muscle soreness.  There is a water fountain on each floor.  You may also bring a water bottle to the 9th floor, but it must be kept in the staff cubicle area of the floor.  Water is not allowed in the processing pods. 
* Closed-toe shoes are recommended, especially when working on projects that involve a significant amount of box moving. 

### 12.2.2 Emotional Care

Stress, pressure, moments of exhaustion and fatigue, conflict, and frustration are all natural parts of any work environment.  Working with archival materials also can be mentally and emotionally draining due to difficulty of subject matter, complexity of the collection and required work, or the tedium of rote tasks such as unfolding tri-fold documents or item-level organization.  There is no way to eliminate these things from our work lives, but there are many strategies to cope with and reduce the stress and fatigue caused by our work:

* Create and maintain healthy daily habits.   
* Take breaks.  You are encouraged to take regular breaks during your shift, but additional breaks are acceptable if you feel overwhelmed by a collection.  Collections such as the Neighbor's Network records and the Langmuir photograph collection have been particularly triggering for staff and students.  Physical distance can help create emotional distance when working with such material.   
* Set and enforce healthy professional boundaries.  Avoid work activity such as checking email outside of business hours (though some exceptions may occasionally arise). Identify ways to create privacy in the open floor plan office setting when necessary. 
* Use techniques such as mindfulness meditation to manage stress. Take advantage of services offered by the library such as the coloring station in the first floor staff break room or attend mindfulness group meetings. 
* Talk with your colleagues or supervisor.  Verbally processing feelings can help reduce frustration.  Your supervisor can also help formulate a plan and/or identify resources for addressing conflict or other issues that arise. 
* Listen to your favorite music.  Headphones and phones/iPods are allowed in workspaces, but talk with your supervisor if there are questions about permissible media. 
* Adjust your work schedule.  Work/life balance is important and temporary or permanent changes to your schedule can help recalibrate this balance. 
* Many of the strategies for physical self-care, such as physical activity throughout the day and staying well-hydrated, also promote emotional self-care.
