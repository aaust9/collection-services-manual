## 9.1 Preservation during Processing

Preservation treatment in a collection corresponds to the level of arrangement and description for the collection. During high level/minimal processing, archivists look mostly for large-scale problems that affect the entire collection (or large parts of it) such as mold and water damage; large segments of fragile documents that need to be stabilized or restricted from use; poor packing; lack of folders; and items that need special housing such as oversized or bound material.

During detailed processing, archivists may do more granular preservation work like removing rusty fasteners and sleeving torn documents. Preservation activities at this level should focus on mitigating further damage to the collection and enhancing access for patrons while maintaining efficient use of staff time. For example, staff should always make preservation photocopies of thermal fax paper because there is no other way to prevent loss of information. However, staff should not make preservation photocopies of newspaper clippings as a matter of course because of the common availability of that information. 

Conduct the following minor preservation work during processing: 

* When foldering, ensure that the folder is creased to the appropriate width for the materials inside. Leaving too much space or overstuffing the folder can cause damage such as slumping and tearing. 
* When boxing folders, ensure that the box is filled fully. It should not require a lot of wiggling to remove a folder and there should not be any visible space at the back of a box.  In an appropriately filled box, an average folder should remain stable when partially pulled from the box. Partially filled or overstuffed boxes cause damage such as slumping and tearing. 
* Remove letters from envelopes. This ensures that continued refolding over time in the reading room will not weaken paper fibers and lead to tears. 
* Unfold/flatten all documents, including bent corners. As above, this reduces repeated folding and unfolding that weakens the paper and causes tears. Smoothing bent corners prevents papers from catching on each other and causing more damage. Use discretion when unfolding oversized material; if the item does not warrant oversized storage, unfold it as much as possible and leave it in a standard legal folder. 
* Remove rusting hardware and fasteners that are causing damage to material. This includes staples and paper clips that are causing physical damage such as tearing and rusty fasteners that have eaten through paper or left stains. This does not include slightly rusted or corroded staples and paper clips that have not caused damage to this point.  Stable environmental controls will prevent damage from developing. 
* Photocopy all thermal fax paper (glossy paper similar to receipt paper). The nature of fax paper causes information printed on it to fade over time. Photocopying is the only way to preserve that information. When photocopying, if all of the content of a document transfers legibly to the photocopy, discard the original fax. If severely faded areas of the original fax do not copy and show as blank spots on the photocopy, keep both the original and the new copy. 
* Disbind material in three-ring binders or spiral bound booklets that are causing damage or are difficult to folder. Pages that have been stored in three ring binders often stick together over time. Very carefully separate these pages. If they will not easily separate, consult the Rose Library manuscript preservation liaison. 
* Sleeve torn documents in mylar and flag significantly damaged documents for further conservation treatment. A significantly damaged document is torn in half or still at risk even after it has been sleeved. 
* Sleeve old or torn photographs in polyester photograph sleeves. Do not sleeve all photographs as a matter of course. 
* Enter information about audiovisual materials into the [Audiovisual Inventory Update Form](https://emory.box.com/s/8s91q65h56yqxop1t37o11oc06qv52qf) to be considered for digitization, noting if there are commercial recordings.

Do not attempt to mend documents with pressure sensitive tape, even tape marketed as "archival." 

When working with moldy materials, segregate the damaged items from the rest of the collection. Those items will go to the conservation lab for cleaning. When they return, complete processing but keep the moldy material physically segregated. Physically add them to a new box(es) at the end of the collection and describe them intellectually in the finding aid. Label the outside of the box(es) with "Mold Alert" labels according to instructions in  [6.6.2 Boxing collections](/06-LOCAL%20PRACTICE#662-boxing-collections).

When processing is complete, shelve the box(es) on the ranges designated for housing moldy materials (11-245-A-C) and update the shelf list to indicate the additional location. Moldy materials cannot be sent to the LSC per Rose [policy](https://emory.app.box.com/file/51648381053). 

For questions about possible preservation needs in a collection, consult the Rose Library Preservation Liaison. 

## 9.2 Sending Collection Material to the Conservation Lab 
 
The Head of Collection Services, Rose Library Preservation Liaison, Rare Book Cataloger, and Accessioning and Collections Manager meet quarterly to discuss preservation priorities and plan treatments for the upcoming quarter. Moldy items, photographs stuck together, torn pages, and special rehousing of large or oddly shaped materials are among the most common conservation problems in manuscript collections. 

### 9.2.1 Manuscript and Archival Material

The process by which manuscript and archives items enter and move through the queue is as follows: 

1. If preservation problems are found, notify the Rose Library preservation liaison for manuscripts and archives who will consult with the Preservation Office. The Rose Library preservation liaison is the only staff person who may transfer manuscript and archives material the preservation lab. Conservators will not accept material for treatment from any other staff person. 
2. Rose Library liaison will add the item to the [conservation list](https://emory.app.box.com/file/48967021481).   
3. Rose Library liaison assesses the problem/material and assigns it a category based on the following criteria: extent of damage, value, use, relationship to other projects, and other institutional needs (such as loans).  
4. Rose Library liaison creates a transaction for the item in Aeon. For processed collections, create the transaction by requesting the item through the finding aid. For unprocessed collections, create a transaction manually. Manual transactions must include: 
	* Document type [MSS or EUA];
	* Title [Collection title statement];
	* Item description [Folder title or brief description of material if unprocessed];
	* Author [Creator/Main entry];
	* Call number [MSS or Series number];
	* Volume/Box;
	* Folder.
5. Rose Library liaison adds description of the preservation problem to the notes field on the request. 
6. Using the "Print Request" button, print three copies of call slip: 
	* One for the Rose Library liaison's records;
	* One that travels with the item to the Preservation Office;
	* And one to put in place of the item in the box or folder (if necessary).
7. In Aeon, the Rose Library liaison will check the item out to In Conservation--Normal Workflow and place a copy of the call slip in the box or folder in place of the item. 
8. If necessary, the Rose Library liaison will add the note [Restricted: In preservation] to the proper folder(s) in the collection finding aid. 
9. Rose Library liaison will deliver item and call slip to the Preservation Office during the monthly meeting. Moldy materials receive immediate attention and can be delivered off-schedule. 
10. Rose Library liaison and preservation staff will discuss the level and types of treatment.  A due date for return of the item to the Rose Library should also be determined. 
11. When the item is returned, the Rose Library liaison will refile the item in the collection and check the item back in using Aeon. If part of an ongoing processing project, the liaison will return the material to the appropriate archivist. 
12. The Rose Library liaison will add a new note to the request record including both a description of the problem, a description of the treatment, and the date the item was returned. The liaison will reprint the call slip and file it in the collection CL-2 file. Re-writing the note is necessary because Aeon will only print the information contained in the most recent note in the record. 
13. The Rose Library preservation liaison for manuscripts and archives meets on the first Monday of every month with the Preservation Office to discuss the current list of materials on the spreadsheet awaiting treatment, in addition to the materials undergoing treatment, in order to ensure everything is on schedule. 

### 9.2.2 Books

The Rare Book Cataloger is responsible for managing and tracking workflow of books and broadsides to Preservation.  

Collection Services staff may identify items that need repair at the point of cataloging, during stacks walk-throughs, in the reading room, or before items go on or return from exhibition. Very infrequently items are too fragile to catalog and move directly to Preservation. Any item that needs preservation should be brought to the attention of the Rare Book Cataloger.  

The process by which books enter and move through the queue is as follows: 

1. Preservation issues identified at point of cataloging: catalogers will flag items for Preservation on the tab where they notate the call number and send them to Marking. 
2. After the item is properly marked, the Marking student moves those items to the designated “PreservationPrep” bays. The Rare Book Cataloger monitors this space and sends carts of items to Preservation as needed. These items will be marked “Preservation” in Alma, and may not be requested in Aeon through discovereE. 
3. When items are finished in Preservation, preservation staff notifies the Rare Book Cataloger and the Cataloger facilitates the return to Rose. The status “Preservation” is removed in Alma and pages reshelve items. As soon as the status is changed, the item can be requested in Aeon. 
4. The Rare Book Cataloger sends all books with boards or covers that are flaking, fraying, or showing additional damage to preservation for acid free enclosures. They also send all rare books with jackets to preservation for mylar jacket covers. 

**Special Procedures:**

* Bring any vault items that need treatment to the attention of the Rare Book Cataloger immediately. The Rare Book Cataloger will send these items directly to Preservation, and they have priority in the Preservation Department. 
* Give any items showing mold, or suspected of being moldy to the Rare Book Cataloger for immediate delivery to Preservation, whether or not they have been cataloged. If the cataloger is out of the office, give the items to the Preservation liaison or the Head of Collection Services. In this case, whomever delivers the item to the Preservation Office will mark it as unavailable in Alma. 

### 9.2.3 Audiovisual Material

While the audiovisual liaison works independently of the the Head of Collection Services, Rose Library Preservation Liaison, Rare Book Cataloger, and Accessioning and Collections Manager, audiovisual materials are also reviewed and sent to the Conservation Lab for preservation.  The process by which manuscript and archives items enter and move through the queue is as follows:

1. Because audiovisual materials are only accessible via digital surrogates, digitization is considered a preservation component through the access of the materials. During processing, audiovisual materials should be physically grouped together, and the [Audiovisual Inventory Update Form](https://emory.box.com/s/8s91q65h56yqxop1t37o11oc06qv52qf) should be filled out for the collection. This information will be marked as priority for digitization. **Note:** Commercial recordings are not necessarily removed at this time since access may be granted on the rarity of the items.
2. Rose Library liaison will add the item to the [Conservation List](https://emory.box.com/s/r7oai35rw67twxqws63wg953s96vn7hy) on Box 
3. Rose Library liaison assesses priority of the material as well as the risk assessment for digitization.
4. If [items are requested by patrons](https://emory.box.com/s/hv0grh9jpgqiq9qpjff9773mobp4va0e), Research Services staff will track the transaction in AEON 
5. Rose Library liaison will create a collection-level record in the Keep, and deliver item and Audiovisual Conservator on demand, updating the Conservation List with dates of delivery.
6. Rose Library liaison and Audiovisual Conservator will discuss the estimated return date.
7. Once returned, the Rose Library liaison will update the Conservation List, the rights statement, and Keep metadata as well as create digital access object tags in the encoded finding aid.  Research Services staff will be notified if the transaction is patron driven. 
8. Rose Library liaison will return materials to shelf
