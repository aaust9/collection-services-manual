Emory University contracts with FedEx for shipping needs. Shipping is needed when either the donor or seller is shipping collection material to the Rose directly and/or a curator or other staff member is going to pack a collection that will then be shipped to the Rose. Please be aware that processes differ between domestic and international shipping methods.  

## 15.1 FedEx Drop-Off

If a collection is approximately 20 boxes or less, there is a Rose Library staff member onsite, and the FedEx pickup location is a residence, the collection should be dropped off at a FedEx location by the Rose Library staff member. FedEx requires that someone 18+ years of age wait at the residence for a four hour window for a pickup, and how well the pickup goes is entirely dependent on the luck of the driver who is assigned the job. Dropping off small collections whenever possible is better for our donors. If the collection is too big or there are other factors preventing a drop-off, the Rose Library staff member should remain present for the FedEx pickup whenever possible. The Accessioning Archivist can potentially scheduled pickups ahead of a packing trip with enough lead time and a relatively accurate estimate of number of boxes in order to make it possible for the staff member to plan to be present for the pickup.

Whenever possible, FedEx should **not** be used to move local collections. Collections in the Atlanta area may be transferred to the library by Rose Library staff or a local moving company. FedEx is only an option in exceptional circumstances. 

## 15.2 FedEx Ground

**DOMESTIC SHIPPING ONLY**

* FedEx Ground cannot be used for international shipments;
* FedEx Ground pickups can be scheduled to occur for the next business day. *It is prudent to give the Accessioning Archivist at least 48 hours' notice to schedule any FedEx pickup*. 
* FedEx picks up Ground shipments Monday-Friday. For businesses, they will come during business hours, 8:00am-6:00pm. For residences, they will come anytime between 8:00am and 8:00pm, and they will also pick up on Saturdays. For residences, a four hour timeframe can often be requested, depending on some additional contributing factors, such as amount of time between request date and pickup date.  
* An adult over the age of 18 must be present for the FedEx pickup. FedEx may arrive any time during the designated window, including right before it closes. 
* FedEx will not offer or guarantee a call prior to arrival, though one can be requested.
* FedEx policy is to not enter residences; they ask that boxes be left in an accessible area. However, they have been known to enter foyers and similar areas, if requested, when donors/sellers are older, for example. Again, this can be requested as part of the pickup but cannot be guaranteed.  
* The Rose Library cannot guarantee a phone call or entrance to any dwelling by a FedEx driver. 

## 15.3 FedEx Express (Express Saver)

**DOMESTIC SHIPPING**

FedEx offers several services under their "Express" umbrella, including Express Saver, 2Day, 2Day A.M., Standard Overnight, Priority Overnight, First Overnight, SameDay City, and SameDay. The differences between these services has nothing to do with the pickup procedures, just the delivery window. So, for our purposes, we will only use the most economical option, **Express Saver**, unless we are shipping from Alaska or Hawaii.  

FedEx Express Saver is still significantly more expensive than FedEx Ground. For example, to send a 15lb package to Virginia costs $12.27 with FedEx Ground and $37.65 with FedEx Express Saver. For a 30lb package, the costs are $18.45 and $62.85, respectively. Cost goes up as distance (as relative to Atlanta) and weight increase. 

It is recommended to *only* use FedEx Express Saver when all of the following criteria are met: 

1. The pickup location is a residence; 
2. There are more than 20 boxes;
3. A staff member is unable wait for the pickup;
4. Boxes could not be placed in an openly accessible area for the pickup and the donor will be unable to assist the driver with access to the boxes (such as lifting them over a threshold); 
5. The donor/seller is unable or unwilling to wait for the pickup;
6. The pickup location is relatively close in proximity to Atlanta, Georgia (meaning in the Southeast). Please always offer FedEx Ground to the donor/seller first to gauge flexibility before offering FedEx Express Saver. 

* FedEx Express pickups can be scheduled up until 7:15pm Monday-Friday for same day pickup (they will pick up within two hours after the request is made) and up until 1:00pm for Saturday for same day pickup. Saturday pickup is an additional charge. These cut off hours are based on picking up in Atlanta and may vary in other locations but will probably be similar in large cities like Atlanta. *It is prudent to give the Accessioning Archivist at least 48 hours' notice to schedule any FedEx pickup*.
* FedEx picks up Express shipments Monday-Friday with Saturday pickup available in many areas for an additional charge. 
* A specific timeframe may be designated for a pickup (such as between 10:00am and 2:00pm); FedEx mainly wants to know how late they can pick up the shipment, as opposed to how early they can pick up the shipment. 
* An adult over the age of 18 must be present for the FedEx pickup. 
* FedEx will not offer or guarantee a call prior to arrival, though one can be requested. 
* FedEx policy is to not enter residences; they ask that boxes be left in an accessible area. However, they have been known to enter foyers and similar areas, if requested, when donors/sellers are older, for example. Again, this can be requested as part of the pickup but cannot be guaranteed.  
* The Rose Library cannot guarantee a phone call or entrance to any dwelling by a FedEx driver. 

## 15.4 FedEx Express (International Economy)

**INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING**

* Once the Accessioning Archivist requests a FedEx pickup for International Economy and receives a confirmation number, the donor/seller will receive a call from their local FedEx office to coordinate a pickup time directly.  
* International FedEx pickup requests are, indeed, *requests*-there is no guarantee that FedEx will accept our request for a pickup. FedEx always advises that the request for pickup could be denied. It is important to communicate this risk to the donor since it is FedEx policy. From February 2016 to present, none of our requests for pickup have been denied. 
* Donors/sellers also have the option to drop off their packages at a FedEx location. This is especially encouraged in terms of international shipping, when possible, since the FedEx request is not guaranteed.
