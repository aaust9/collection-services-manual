This document provides guidance on specific arrangement and description tasks, according to local policy and practice at the Rose Library. 

When writing descriptive records for the Rose Library you should conform first and foremost to the conventions of the descriptive or bibliographic standard (DACS, MARC) that you are using.  The Emory University Communications and Public Affairs Office provides additional [style guidance](http://communications.emory.edu/resources/identity/guidelines/style-guide-editorial/index.html) for Emory publications related content and Collection Services maintains a [unit-specific style guide](https://emory.app.box.com/notes/161764012821) for issues that commonly arise during description, including grammatical and spelling preferences and guidance on formulating folder titles. 

## 6.1 Original Folders

Always retain original containers and folders if they contain important or substantive writing, or if they bear a unique relationship to their contents.  Additionally, if the folders are in good shape, they may be retained as primary housing for the materials. Otherwise, folder titles and other basic information may be transcribed and the original container discarded.  If a folder or envelope is too large or bulky to fit in a standard size box, the relevant information can be photocopied and the original item can be discarded.  

## 6.2 Empty Envelopes

Retain empty postal envelopes that include return addresses.  These can be arranged at the end of a group of correspondence as "Envelopes, empty." 

## 6.3 Photographs

As a general rule, all photographs in a collection are kept unless the photograph contains subject matter that is insignificant within the context of the collection (i.e. a snapshot of a flower).  Photographs are typically described by format, but this may vary depending on the collection and its original order, size, or complexity.  Photographs that are attached or connected to other materials should not usually be physically separated, but remain in their original location to retain meaningful contextual information.  For additional guidance see [RESTRICTIONS AND SEPARATIONS]  

## 6.4 Newspaper Clippings

Newspaper clippings should be appraised for their relevancy to a collection and only those that are about the creator or their work should be kept.  Clippings are commonly available outside the archives and should never be arranged or described in detail.  They can be described as "Clippings, [date range]" and be boxed or foldered without sorting.  Preservation photocopies should not be made, nor should clippings be unfolded to create oversized papers (OP).  Weed duplicates if they're obvious, but do not waste time trying to identify duplicates. 

## 6.5 Audiovisual Material

Audiovisual materials can be described separately by format or intellectually with other records by function.  Physically, sound and video recordings should be housed in audiovisual (AV) masters boxes.  For preservation purposes, sound and video recordings should be housed separately when possible.  When working with a small amount of recordings, everything can be housed together in one box. For additional information about AV workflows see [Processing guidelines for audiovisual materials](https://github.com/rose-collectionservices/collection-services-manual/blob/master/06-LOCAL%20PRACTICE/processing-guidelines-for-audiovisual-materials.md) 

## 6.6 Housing and Storage

### 6.6.1 Folders

Use legal-size folders as the default and do not overstuff folders. See the [preservation chapter](/9-PRESERVATION/readme.md) for additional information on proper foldering.

Folders should be labeled with the following information: 

* Abbreviated form of the collection title (usually the creator's last name or an abbreviation of the organization's name);
* Collection number;
* Series/subseries title, if applicable;
* Bolded header, if applicable;
* Box number;
* Folder number.

![Figure 1: Folder labeling](/06-LOCAL%20PRACTICE/Images/Figure1.jpg "Folder labeling")

Separate the collection title and manuscript number, series and subseries titles, and box and folder numbers with a slash.  The box number always precedes the folder number.  When using bolded headers, they should be followed by a colon before writing the folder title.  Separate segments of the folder title with commas. 

### 6.6.2 Boxing Collections

Processed collections should be placed into acid-neutral, archival containers.  In the Rose, we primarily house collection in Hollinger document cases or Paige Miracle boxes.  These boxes are expensive and should not be used for temporary storage projects in cases where the boxes will be broken back down at the end of a project.

Folders should be placed within the box with enough room that the archivist's fingers just reach the bottom. The box should be full enough that folders do not slouch, but not so full that folders cannot be removed easily. If a box is properly packed, a single folder can be partially lifted from the box and not fall back down.  Spacers should be used when there are not enough folders to fill a box properly (usually necessary in the last box of paper materials in a collection). If materials have been removed for preservation or exhibition, space should be held for those materials. 

**Digital media** (e.g., hard drives, floppy disks, flash drives) should be removed from the general holdings and placed in boxes labelled "BD." Place smaller items in envelopes and label accordingly. Check that media has been recorded in the Born Digital Inventory (stored as a tab on the Master Shelf List). If media was not added to this inventory during accessioning, add the details during processing.  Born digital media can be stored in AV boxes if there are only a handful of items that do not warrant a box of their own.  Be especially certain to note the box location in the Born Digital Inventory in these cases.  

**Audiovisual materials** should be removed from the general holdings and placed in boxes labeled "AV." Ideally, sound recordings should be separated from video recordings, but if there is only a small amount in the collection (less than one box), they can be housed together. Phonographs, because of their size, often do not fit on regular sized shelves and are housed on the LP shelves in the Nunnery. In the case that there are not enough LPs from one collection to fill a phonograph box, they may be housed in one of the combined LP (CLP) boxes. 

Documents and photographs larger than 8.5" x 14" are considered **oversized (OP)**. These materials should be housed in oversized folders within oversized boxes. There are two sizes of oversized boxes, 16" x 20" and 20"x24".  Items that are too large to fit in a box, but are not longer than 36" can be placed in large folders and stored on the OP shelves without a box. Materials larger than that are identified as extra-oversized (XOP) and are shelved in folders in the Nunnery. 

When possible, **framed items** such as photographs, certificates, or artwork, should be unframed and stored according to the size of the item. If it is not possible to remove the frame, the item can be secured with pH buffered paper or bubble wrap and housed in an oversized box.  In this case, it should be described in the finding aid as an OP.  Framed items that cannot be boxed should be labeled and hung on the 11th floor art racks.  Describe these items in the finding aid as framed items (FR).  Do not affix labels to the frames themselves. Print a small (OP box sized) label, affix the label to a strip of acid free card stock, punch a hole in the top, and tie the label to the hanger on the frame. If the frame does not have hanging hardware on the back, consult with the preservation liaison. Do not add any framed items to the art racks without first identifying and labeling them appropriately. 

**Bound volumes (BV)** and **oversized bound volumes (OBV)** are usually ledgers, scrapbooks, photograph albums, or other bound items.  Bound items that will fit in a regular Hollinger box should be placed in folders and stored as normal.  Bound items that are too large to reside with the rest of collection should be boxed separately and identified in the finding aid as BVs or OBVs.  When boxing multiple items together, insert a strip of acid-free card stock into each item identifying it. 

**Box labels** should include the following information (see figure 2 for an example): 

* Emory University;
* Rose Library;
* Manuscript or EUA number;
* Main entry (dates do not have to be included and should not be included if they're subject to change, i.e. if the person is still living); 
* Collection title (do not include the date range in the title statement since it will change in the event of accruals);
* Box number.

![Figure 2: Box labeling](/06-LOCAL%20PRACTICE/Images/Figure2.jpg "Box labeling")

*Figure 2*

There are three sizes for labels. The most commonly used is the 4" x 3 1/3" labels. These are used for record center boxes and Hollinger boxes [link to template].  Smaller labels measuring 4" x 2" are used for the half Hollinger boxes as well as the OP boxes [link to template].  There is an additional template for the 4" x 2" labels, specifically formatted for OP boxes measuring 1.5" in depth. 

Restricted material and material that has mold must be housed separately from the rest of the collection.  Restricted material should be boxed in a way that facilitates providing access to the material once the restrictions have expired.  For example, if there are multiple levels of restriction in a collection, box materials subject to the same restrictions together.  When the restrictions expire, the box can simply be relabled and folders within redescribed as accessible in the finding aid.   

**Examples:**

*Hollinger box (.5 linear feet):* Label should be placed in the middle, under the flap. The barcode should be placed on the middle of the bottom of the flap.

![Figure 3: Regular Hollinger box](/06-LOCAL%20PRACTICE/Images/Figure3.jpg "Regular Hollinger box")

*Half Hollinger box (.25 linear feet):* Label should be placed in the middle, under the flap. The barcode should be placed on the middle of the bottom of the flap.

![Figure 4: Half Hollinger box](/06-LOCAL%20PRACTICE/Images/Figure4.jpg "Half Hollinger box")

*Record center box (1 linear foot):* Label should be placed in the middle, under the handle with enough room to place the barcode between the handle and the label. 

![Figure 5: Record center box](/06-LOCAL%20PRACTICE/Images/Figure5.jpg "Record center box")

*Oversized papers box (also applies to bound and oversized bound volume boxes):* Label should be placed on the left side of the front of the box. The barcode should be placed to the right of the label. 

![Figure 6: Oversized papers box](/06-LOCAL%20PRACTICE/Images/Figure6.jpg "Oversized papers box")

Boxes that contain **moldy material** should be labeled with two brightly colored alert labels: "Mold Alert," and "Researcher Alert."  These should be placed on the box so that the "Mold Alert" label faces out on the shelf and the "Researcher Alert" label is visible to patrons when the boxes are in use.  You can use scotch tape to affix the labels to the boxes but make sure the labels are taped on at least two sides and not in danger of being ripped off by frequent use. See figures 7-9 for examples.

### 6.6.3 Restricted Material

Materials deemed restricted should be physically isolated in a separate box. The box should be clearly stamped with the RESTRICTED stamp to avoid any unauthorized access (see figure 10). 

![Figure 10: Restricted material](/06-LOCAL%20PRACTICE/Images/Figure10.jpg "Restricted material")

*Figure 10*

There may additionally be restrictions on how patrons may use material, such as **prohibitions on photography** or **reproduction restrictions** that are also indicated by a stamp on the label. See figures 11-13 for examples.

![Figure 11: No personal photography](/06-LOCAL%20PRACTICE/Images/Figure11.jpg "No personal photography")

![Figure 12: Reproduction restrictions](/06-LOCAL%20PRACTICE/Images/Figure12.jpg "Reproduction restrictions")

*Figure 12: Reproduction restrictions, used primarily for boxes that contain sheet music or scores. When affixing this label to boxes, you may place the label higher on the flap to accommodate barcodes.*

![Figure 13: No camera](/06-LOCAL%20PRACTICE/Images/Figure13.jpg "No camera")

*Figure 13: When the restriction only applies to one or a few folders in the box, also stamp the folders with the "no camera" stamp as a visual cue for patrons and staff.*
