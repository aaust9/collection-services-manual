## 7.1 Restricted Material

Materials can be restricted for a number of reasons, but primarily, the Rose Library restricts records due to donor request, preservation concerns, and protection of privacy. 

### 7.1.2 Donor Imposed Restrictions

Donors may request that the Rose Library restrict portions of their collection.  The details of the restrictions should be worked out between the donor and curator during negotiations for the acquisition of the collection.  The restrictions should be described as explicitly as possible in the deed of gift or sale and should always include an expiration date.  Archival staff will have access to restricted material for the purposes of accessioning and processing but should keep information about the documents strictly confidential.  

The following is an example of a clear, detailed, and actionable set of donor restrictions:

*The following material will be restricted for a period of ten (10) years from the date of execution of this agreement:*

* *Correspondence: Young has provided a list of correspondents, mostly fellow writers, whose correspondence can be opened upon receipt by the Rose Library (see attached).  The remainder of the correspondence will remain closed for 10 years.*
* *Manuscript of Colson Whitehead’s first, unpublished, novel The Colossus of New York.*

*The following born digital material is permanently restricted if present on any of the transferred computers and should not be made available to researchers:*   

* *Email*
* *Digital photographs*

*The following material should be removed from the collection and returned to Young if identified by Rose Library staff:*

* *Financial records (records of a purely financial nature such as credit card statements or tax forms. Does not apply to other types of records such as contracts or permissions agreements where limited financial information may be present)* 
* *Medical records* 
* *Materials created by, or relating exclusively to, Young’s son, Mac*

*The Rose Library will consult with Young about any materials they find created by Young’s father, or collected or assembled by him in the course of his business as a physician, to determine whether to retain as part of the collection or return to Young.*

### 7.1.3 Preservation

In some cases, original material may be too fragile for general access in the reading room and should be restricted.  For paper, photographs, and objects, consult with the Preservation Liaison before making this decision.  Rose staff will make access copies of restricted documents when possible.  Items that are restricted due to fragility also receive higher priority in the conservation queue.  Original sound and video/film recordings and born digital media are always restricted from use by patrons.  Patrons may examine the physical media, but may not access content via the original items.  Access copies of audiovisual and digital material will be made on demand or as part of normal processing workflows.  Additional guidance on preservation practices and workflows is [AVAILABLE HERE AND THEN ALSO AV WORKFLOW]. 

### 7.1.4 Protection of Privacy

Manuscript collections contain the traces of an individual’s life, which can include documenting very public accomplishments, as well as very personal relationships and life events.  While restricted information or document types should be identified at the time of acquisition and outlined in the deed of gift or sale, there are cases when Rose Library accessioning or processing staff may identify confidential material in the course of working with a collection.  There are important legal and ethical distinctions between information that is considered confidential, and that which may be private or sensitive. 

| ﻿Confidential vs. Private |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Confidential records:    | Any records that must be restricted from public access for a period of time to ensure compliance with legal or statutory regulations.  Examples include third party student records (FERPA), personnel records, some medical records (HIPAA), social security numbers, and privileged attorney-client or doctor-patient communications. |
| Private information:     | May include categories of information that a donor wishes to restrict for a period of time, such as correspondence with a particular individual, financial information, or records of or about a third party.                                                                                                                           |
 
To the best of our ability, and the extent that is reasonable based on the level of processing, Rose Library staff reviews collection material for records containing confidential information and redacts, removes, or otherwise restricts these documents.  In addition to confidential records, we also make every reasonable attempt to locate and redact or restrict any material stipulated in the donor agreement.  While the Rose staff makes every good faith effort to identify this information in the records, the nature of archival processing is to deal with records in the aggregate, and Rose staff are not in a position to examine or inspect every document.  Archivists are trained in document analysis and can generally identify series or portions of a collection that are the most likely to contain confidential information and will concentrate efforts on those groups.  
 
The legal right to privacy ends with an individual’s death.  Restrictions on social security numbers, grade sheets, or other potentially confidential records can be lifted at the end of a person’s life, and we will not redact this information about deceased individuals. 
 
Generally, staff does not evaluate collection contents for subjectively sensitive information.  Staff will not restrict material without a request from the donor or an affected third party, or outside of accordance with University policy or state and federal statute.  Collection Services will make this decision in consultation with the Head of Collection Services, the curator responsible for acquisition, the donor, and in accordance with professional ethical standards. 
  
 
When materials have been designated as restricted, Collection Services will: 
 
* Physically isolate restricted documents from the rest of the collection and clearly label the boxes as restricted; * Create access copies and surrogates for fragile material when possible;
* Describe the restricted items as fully as possible in the finding aid, including container lists and appropriate narrative description.  In cases where the donor may not want information about restrictions to be made public, describe the material as normal and [redact] (<https://emory.app.box.com/file/195790907452> "https://emory.app.box.com/file/195790907452") it in the EAD finding aid;
* Include the types of records that are restricted, the reason for the restriction, and the date of expiration in [Restrictions on Access] (/05-DESCRIPTION) notes;
* Fully document restrictions via deeds of gift/sale, correspondence, memos, etc., in the permanent collection file.  

## 7.2 Redacted Material

Often, rather than restricting an entire document, you can simply redact the information in question and provide access to the altered copy in place of the original.   

To redact information, either:

* Place an opaque bit of paper over the information to be redacted and make a photocopy (do not adhere the paper to the original document);
* Include the following text on the photocopy:  "This is a redacted copy of the original document, with [redacted information, i.e. Social Security Numbers] obscured to protect the privacy/security of the individuals mentioned." 

Or:

* Make a photocopy of the original document;
* Using a black Sharpie marker, block out the information to be redacted on the photocopy;
* Make a second photocopy and dispose of the first copy in the confidential shredding bin;
* Repeat if sensitive information is still visible on the second copy;
* Include the following text on the photocopy:  "This is a redacted copy of the original document, with [redacted information, i.e. Social Security Numbers] obscured to protect the privacy/security of the individuals mentioned." 

NEVER redact the original document itself.  If the original document has intrinsic value (original correspondence, etc.), restrict the document as normal and retain in the collection.  If the original document is not unique (forms, title pages without annotations, etc.), the original can be discarded in the confidential shredding bin. 

## 7.3 Separated materials

For access and preservation considerations, some materials may be physically removed from their original location.  Materials can be moved either to different locations within a collection or be removed from the collection and managed separately. 

### 7.3.1 Attachments

Items that are attached to each other should only be separated under limited circumstances.  Always remove sound or video/film recordings, books, and other bulky items that affect storage when they are attached to letters or other documents.  If a photograph or other printed item is attached to a document, there is no need to separate the items unless there is something extraordinarily compelling about the attachment and separate description is required. 

If an item is intricately related to another item in a series, the archivist should create a separation form to document the relationship between the two items [link].  Complete the form, attaching one copy to the original item and a second copy to the item being removed. Separation should be done judiciously and only in cases where access to the item is significantly improved by separation. 

In the case of an audio or video recording accompanying a letter or other document, fill out the separation form and file it with the original document.  Create a cross reference to the document in an item level scope and content note in the container list for the audio or video recording. For example [Originally filed in Series 1: Correspondence, Letter from April Chung to May Riley, January 24, 1999]   

### 7.3.2 Publications

Published monographs, broadsides, and periodicals that are rare or are closely connected to our broader collecting areas are removed and cataloged.  For publications that do not contain any annotations, signatures, or other unique features, the Manuscript Archivist or a student processing assistant should check DiscoverE to see if the Rose Library already holds a copy.  If so, the item can likely be deaccessioned.  Confer with the curator responsible for acquisition of the collection to determine if there's a compelling reason to keep the copy in question with the collection.  If the item is being transferred to Rare Books for cataloging, complete a "Removed from MSS Collection (to be cataloged)" flag [link], insert it into the publication, and shelve the item on the designated range.  When dealing with large quantities, it is more efficient to complete the form electronically and print out the appropriate number of flags.  Do not leave books in records center cartons or other boxes on the rare book shelves.  When publications are attached to documents and that provenance must be preserved, complete the Separation Form (Books) [link] and follow the procedures as normal.  If the item will not remain in the Rose collection either return to the donor or to Better World Books as appropriate.
